    "## Using generative AI to create music \n",
    "There have been two primary approaches to generating music using ML techniques. In the first approach, the problem of music generation is treated as an image generation problem. In the second approach, music generation is treated like a time-series problem. To solve these kinds of problems, musicians and data scientists have traditionally used convolutional neural network (CNN) modeling techniques. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The [Google Bach Doodle](https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-johann-sebastian-bach) used an algorithm called [CocoNET](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/coconet) to generate music using generative AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The [MuseGAN](https://openai.com/blog/musegan/) model is based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using autoregressive approaches for image generation\n",
    "In a traditional autoregressive approach, you condition an upcoming value on the values that came before it. This kind of approach helps create realistic images. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **PixelCNN** is a type of autoregressive generative model. It predicts an image pixel based off of all previously generated image pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Orderless NADE** approach is similar to the PixelCNN approach except that generation of the pixels is *ordering invariant*, meaning that the generation of the next pixel doesn't necessarily have to be linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The AWS DeepComposer approach to generating music  \n",
    "Autoregressive-based approaches are prone to accumulate errors during training. To help mitigate this problem, we train our AR-CNN model so that it can detect and then fix mistakes, including those made by the model itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this by treating music generation as a series of *edit events*, which can be either the addition or removal of a note. An *edit sequence* is a series of edit events. Every edit sequence can directly correspond to a piano roll.\n",
    "\n",
    "By training our model to view the problem as edit events rather than as an entire image or just the addition of notes, we found that it can offset the accumulation of errors and generate higher quality music.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand the basic theory behind our approach, let’s dive into the code. In the next section, we show examples of the piano roll format that we use for training the model."
