## Music Terminologies

*__Pitch:__* how high or low a note is being perceived by our brain 

*__Duration:__* length of the sound 

*__Loudness:__* how ‘loud’ or ‘quiet’ the sound is 

*__Timbre:__* what makes sounds different from each other. It is what makes us differentiate from the same pitch played by a guitar versus a piano or your fellow programmer whistling Iron Maiden.

*__Note:__* a symbol denoting a musical sound. Represent the pitch and duration of a sound

In western music, notes are represented with the first 7 letters (A, B, C, D, E, F and G) or in Europe by La, [t/s]i, Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol

The eighth note, or octave, is given the same name as the first, but has double its frequency. 

To differentiate, we usually put a number after the letter
E.g: C3 (middle C in the piano), C4 is one octave above (2x frequency of C3)
